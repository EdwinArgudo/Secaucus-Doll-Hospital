                    We remember and honor Alba Sánchez, a gifted modista, a cherished member of the Sanchez family, and a beloved part of the Secaucus Doll Hospital legacy.

                    Alba had a gentle way of bringing things to life with thread, fabric, and her hands. Her work was not only craftsmanship—it was care, soul, and tradition woven into every stitch. For those who knew her, Alba’s presence was calming, her laughter a comfort, and her dedication unwavering.
                    
                    She gave new life not only to dolls, but to memories. Her hands mended what was broken, and her heart held what others cherished. To the families who brought their heirlooms to the Hospital, she offered quiet reassurance. To those who worked beside her, she was a guide, a friend, and an inspiration.
                    
                    Though she has passed, the legacy she leaves behind is alive—in every delicate hem, every lovingly restored doll, and every heart she touched.
                    
                    We carry her memory forward with deep respect and endless gratitude.
                    <br>
                    With love and remembrance,
                    <br>

                    Today, the little store called Secaucus Doll and Teddy Bear Hospital, you can find broken porcelain dolls and torn teddy bears all waiting to be taken care of. The atmosphere is enveloped in an abundance of emotions and passion and greeted by an equal sentiment on behalf of our team. Whom of which have just received a devasting hit after losing doll repair pioneer Luis H. Casas.
                    After 5 long years of battle with Alzheimer’s, has finally succumbed to the illness. His years of dedication, compassion, and fervor towards his craft have, however, not gone unnoticed and have touched the hearts of all the members of our team. We are forever thankful to have had him in our lives and to be blessed with the knowledge he left behind. For as long as people want to recuperate and maintain the manifestation of their memories and emotions, we the Secaucus Doll and Teddy Bear team will continue to provide help to the world with all the passion and empathy Dr. Casas left us with before his departure.
                    May he forever rest in peace and oversee the future of his legacy.
