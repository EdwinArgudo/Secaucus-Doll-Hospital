                    Today, the little store called Secaucus Doll and Teddy Bear Hospital, you can find broken porcelain dolls and torn teddy bears all waiting to be taken care of. The atmosphere is enveloped in an abundance of emotions and passion and greeted by an equal sentiment on behalf of our team. Whom of which have just received a devasting hit after losing doll repair pioneer Luis H. Casas.
                    After 5 long years of battle with Alzheimer’s, has finally succumbed to the illness. His years of dedication, compassion, and fervor towards his craft have, however, not gone unnoticed and have touched the hearts of all the members of our team. We are forever thankful to have had him in our lives and to be blessed with the knowledge he left behind. For as long as people want to recuperate and maintain the manifestation of their memories and emotions, we the Secaucus Doll and Teddy Bear team will continue to provide help to the world with all the passion and empathy Dr. Casas left us with before his departure.
                    May he forever rest in peace and oversee the future of his legacy.
