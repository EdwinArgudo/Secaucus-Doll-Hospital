                In our Before and After Gallery, check out how after a bit of treatment our patients come out looking like new! In our process, we try to preserve as much of the original color and composition of our patients.

                    Our patient Pinocchio was 30-40 years old when he arrived at our Doll and Teddy Bear Hospital. His outer shell consisted of a blend of wood and sawdust, and carried a fine coat of paint that had cracked and become discolored. We gave Pinocchio a new coat of paint, doing our best to use colors that matched the original. With some additional internal repair work to fix cracked wood, Pinocchio left our doll hospital ready for a long life with his family.

                    This bear came into our doll hospital with many rips and tears that needed immediate attention. When we repair any stuffed animal, our priority is to keep as much of the original material as possible and patch holes using like materials so that the outer shell looks cohesive. After some patchwork and detailed sewing, this bear left looking like new!

                    This baby doll entered our doll hospital with damages on its clothing, paint discoloration, and some grime that had built up. After a bath, a repaint, some patchwork done on its clothes, and a complete remake of its shirt, this baby doll was ready for his family.

                    This bunny came into our doll hospital with a lot of outer damage, and lacked good structual integrity because of it. In approaching the repair, it was decided that a large portion of the lower body would be replaced so that the bunny would be more durable, and in the upper body we would patch as much as we could. After a few weeks of hand stitching and custom clothes creation, this bunny was once again ready for play!

                    This bear came into our doll hospital with many missing materials on its nose, eyes, hands, and feet that needed a custom sewing. In the repair process, we ensured that the bear would be able to stand once again by amply replacing the inner stuffing. And under the request of the owner, a custom shirt was made, and with that the bear's stay at the doll hospital was complete.

                    This dinosaur came into our doll hospital with obvious damage to its structual integrity as its upper body had many tears making it barely able to hold the dinosaur together. In our repair process, we made a new upper body out of a stronger fabric to ensure durability and filled holes in areas on its limbs to complete the restore.
